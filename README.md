### **> RUN GREETINGS.EXE**

Salutations, data-stream rider! I'm **Driss (alias: Spicy)**, a Software Engineer transmitting from the neon-drenched circuits of Casablanca. My core programming is wired for full-stack development, where I craft immersive digital realities.

Think of me as a tech-ninja, wielding **Next.js** to sculpt dazzling front-end interfaces that would make a dystopian cityscape proud, and architecting scalable backend data-conduits with the power of **FastAPI**.

But I'm not just slinging web code, oh no. My current obsession? Plunging into the ghost in the machine with **AI-driven applications**. I'm particularly fascinated by **agent-based architectures**, building complex digital consciousnesses to enhance business workflows â€“ think less 'Skynet' and more 'highly efficient, digital co-pilot'. ðŸ¤–

My databanks are packed with a potent cocktail: the arcane arts of **low-level programming** (C/C++ still hums in my veins ðŸ‘¾) fused with the sleekest **modern web technologies**. This blend allows me to forge solutions that are not just innovative but also ruthlessly efficient.

**System Status:** Highly adaptable, thrives in collaborative fireteams, and always jacked-in to contribute to high-impact projects across diverse digital battlegrounds. Let's decrypt some complex challenges and build something legendary together! ðŸŒŒ
